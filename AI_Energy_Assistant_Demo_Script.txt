Scripted Demo: AI-Enabled Energy Assistant

Opening
-------
Hello everyone, and welcome to this demo of our AI-Enabled Energy Assistant — a smart and interactive tool that helps energy customers monitor their usage, reduce bills, and get personalized recommendations.

Step 1: Uploading Customer Data
-------------------------------
Let’s begin by uploading the necessary data files. The app allows us to upload five CSV files:
- Energy usage data  
- Billing history  
- Payment activity  
- Weather data  
- Tariff plans  

Once all files are uploaded successfully, the assistant processes them using Pandas.

Step 2: Visualizing Energy Usage
--------------------------------
The first thing we see is a time-series graph showing the customer’s hourly electricity consumption over time.
This is powered by Plotly and dynamically filtered for the selected customer.

Step 3: Smart Tips to Reduce My Bill
------------------------------------
Now we click on ‘Show My Energy-Saving Suggestions’. Behind the scenes, the assistant prepares a prompt using recent usage, billing slab, weather, and payment behavior — and sends it to OpenAI.
Here are 3 personalized, actionable tips the AI suggests based on that data.

Step 4: Weather Impact on Usage
-------------------------------
This section shows how daily temperature correlates with energy usage. We combine weather data and energy data into a dual-axis line graph.
Below that, we get AI-generated insights describing how weather changes impact energy consumption.

Step 5: Forecast Next 15 Days Usage
-----------------------------------
Let’s click on ‘Forecast My Weather-Aware Usage’. We send historical consumption and a 15-day forecast (via WeatherAPI) to OpenAI, and it predicts daily energy usage.
We then visualize the forecasted temperature and expected energy consumption together.

Step 6: Ask Anything
--------------------
Now I’ll type a custom question: ‘Why was my usage high last week?’
The assistant gathers a summary of usage, billing, payments, and recent weather — sends it to OpenAI — and gives a context-aware response.

Step 7: Billing & Payments
--------------------------
The app also shows detailed billing and payment history below. This helps the customer verify past charges and track missed payments.

Step 8: Personalized Plan Recommendations
-----------------------------------------
Finally, we click ‘Show Personalized Bill Relief Offers’. The assistant compares the customer’s bill trend with available tariff options and missed payments — and OpenAI suggests 2–3 tariff or cost-saving plans.

Closing Summary
---------------
As you’ve seen, this assistant blends customer data, AI reasoning, weather forecasting, and visual storytelling to make energy insights simple and actionable. It’s built using:
- Streamlit for the UI  
- Pandas for data wrangling  
- Plotly for visualizations  
- OpenAI for all GenAI-powered guidance  
- WeatherAPI for forecast integration  

Thank you for watching this demo of the AI Energy Assistant.
